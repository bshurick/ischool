=== Week 2 ASSIGNMENTS using Hadoop Streaming and Python===

HW2.0.  
What is a race condition in the context of parallel computation? Give an example.
What is MapReduce?
How does it differ from Hadoop?
Which programming paradigm is Hadoop based on? Explain and give a simple example in code and show the code running.

HW2.1. Sort in Hadoop MapReduce
Given as input: Records of the form <integer, “NA”>, where integer is any integer, and “NA” is just the empty string.
Output: sorted key value pairs of the form <integer, “NA”> in decreasing order; what happens if you have multiple reducers? Do you need additional steps? Explain.

Write code to generate N  random records of the form <integer, “NA”>. Let N = 10,000.
Write the python Hadoop streaming map-reduce job to perform this sort. Display the top 10 biggest numbers. Display the 10 smallest numbers



HW2.2.  WORDCOUNT
Using the Enron data from HW1 and Hadoop MapReduce streaming, write the mapper/reducer job that  will determine the word count (number of occurrences) of each white-space delimitted token (assume spaces, fullstops, comma as delimiters). Examine the word “assistance” and report its word count results.

 
CROSSCHECK: >grep assistance enronemail_1h.txt|cut -d$'\t' -f4| grep assistance|wc -l    
       8    
       #NOTE  "assistance" occurs on 8 lines but how many times does the token occur? 10 times! This is the number we are looking for!

HW2.2.1  Using Hadoop MapReduce and your wordcount job (from HW2.2) determine the top-10 occurring tokens (most frequent tokens)



HW2.3. Multinomial NAIVE BAYES with NO Smoothing
Using the Enron data from HW1 and Hadoop MapReduce, write  a mapper/reducer job(s) that
   will both learn  Naive Bayes classifier and classify the Enron email messages using the learnt Naive Bayes classifier. Use all white-space delimitted tokens as independent input variables (assume spaces, fullstops, commas as delimiters). Note: for multinomial Naive Bayes, the Pr(X=“assistance”|Y=SPAM) is calculated as follows:

   the number of times “assistance” occurs in SPAM labeled documents / the number of words in documents labeled SPAM 

   E.g.,   “assistance” occurs 5 times in all of the documents Labeled SPAM, and the length in terms of the number of words in all documents labeled as SPAM (when concatenated) is 1,000. Then Pr(X=“assistance”|Y=SPAM) = 5/1000. Note this is a multinomial estimation of the class conditional for a Naive Bayes Classifier. No smoothing is needed in this HW. Multiplying lots of probabilities, which are between 0 and 1, can result in floating-point underflow. Since log(xy) = log(x) + log(y), it is better to perform all computations by summing logs of probabilities rather than multiplying probabilities. Please pay attention to probabilites that are zero! They will need special attention. Count up how many times you need to process a zero probabilty for each class and report. 

   Report the performance of your learnt classifier in terms of misclassifcation error rate of your multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier. Plot a histogram of the log posterior probabilities (i.e., log(Pr(Class|Doc))) for each class over the training set. Summarize what you see. 

   Error Rate = misclassification rate with respect to a provided set (say training set in this case). It is more formally defined here:

Let DF represent the evalution set in the following:
Err(Model, DF) = |{(X, c(X)) ∈ DF : c(X) != Model(x)}|   / |DF|

Where || denotes set cardinality; c(X) denotes the class of the tuple X in DF; and Model(X) denotes the class inferred by the Model “Model”


HW2.4 Repeat HW2.3 with the following modification: use Laplace plus-one smoothing. Compare the misclassifcation error rates for 2.3 versus 2.4 and explain the differences.

For a quick reference on the construction of the Multinomial NAIVE BAYES classifier that you will code,
please consult the "Document Classification" section of the following wikipedia page:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Document_classification

OR the original paper by the curators of the Enron email data:

http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/docs/ceas2006_paper.pdf


HW2.5. Repeat HW2.4. This time when modeling and classification ignore tokens with a frequency of less than three (3) in the training set. How does it affect the misclassifcation error of learnt naive multinomial Bayesian Classifier on the training dataset:

HW2.6 Benchmark your code with the Python SciKit-Learn implementation of the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm

It always a good idea to benchmark your solutions against publicly available libraries such as SciKit-Learn, The Machine Learning toolkit available in Python. In this exercise, we benchmark ourselves against the SciKit-Learn implementation of multinomial Naive Bayes.  For more information on this implementation see: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html more  

In this exercise, please complete the following:

— Run the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm (using default settings) from SciKit-Learn over the same training data used in HW2.5 and report the misclassification error (please note some data preparation might be needed to get the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm from SkiKit-Learn to run over this dataset)
- Prepare a table to present your results, where rows correspond to approach used (SkiKit-Learn versus your Hadoop implementation) and the column presents the training misclassification error
— Explain/justify any differences in terms of training error rates over the dataset in HW2.5 between your Multinomial Naive Bayes implementation (in Map Reduce) versus the Multinomial Naive Bayes implementation in SciKit-Learn 

HHW 2.6.1 OPTIONAL (note this exercise is a stretch HW and optional)
—  Run the Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm from SciKit-Learn (using default settings) over the same training data used in HW2.6 and report the misclassification error 
-  Discuss the performance differences in terms of misclassification error rates over the dataset in HW2.5 between the  Multinomial Naive Bayes implementation in SciKit-Learn with the  Bernoulli Naive Bayes implementation in SciKit-Learn. Why such big differences. Explain. 

Which approach to Naive Bayes would you recommend for SPAM detection? Justify your selection.


HW2.7 OPTIONAL (note this exercise is a stretch HW and optional)

The Enron SPAM data in the following folder enron1-Training-Data-RAW is in raw text form (with subfolders for SPAM and HAM that contain raw email messages in the following form:

--- Line 1 contains the subject
--- The remaining lines contain the body of the email message.

In Python write a script to produce a TSV file called train-Enron-1.txt that has a similar format as the enronemail_1h.txt that you have been using so far. Please pay attend to funky characters and tabs. Check your resulting formated email data in Excel and in Python (e.g., count up the number of fields in each row; the number of SPAM mails and the number of HAM emails). Does each row correspond to an email record with four values? Note: use "NA" to denote empty field values.

HW2.8 OPTIONAL
Using Hadoop Map-Reduce write job(s) to perform the following:
 -- Train a multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier with Laplace plus one smoothing using the data extracted in HW2.7 (i.e., train-Enron-1.txt). Use all white-space delimitted tokens as independent input variables (assume spaces, fullstops, commas as delimiters). Drop tokens with a frequency of less than three (3).
 -- Test the learnt classifier using enronemail_1h.txt and report the misclassification error rate. Remember to use all white-space delimitted tokens as independent input variables (assume spaces, fullstops, commas as delimiters). How do we treat tokens in the test set that do not appear in the training set?

HW2.8.1 OPTIONAL
—  Run  both the Multinomial Naive Bayes and the Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithms from SciKit-Learn (using default settings) over the same training data used in HW2.8 and report the misclassification error on both the training set and the testing set
- Prepare a table to present your results, where rows correspond to approach used (SciKit-Learn Multinomial NB; SciKit-Learn Bernouili NB; Your Hadoop implementation)  and the columns presents the training misclassification error, and the misclassification error on the test data set
-  Discuss the performance differences in terms of misclassification error rates over the test and training datasets by the different implementations. Which approch (Bernouili versus Multinomial) would you recommend for SPAM detection? Justify your selection.
