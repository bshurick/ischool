    "A race condition is what can result from two parallel tasks which originate from the same application but are not properly synchronized, so that the order in which the tasks finish in determines the final result. For example, if you write an application which divides the result of some improperly synchronized process by itself plus another value and loads it back to the original variable, the number that you divide may be different depending on if the threads finish near the same time or if one thread reads the result of another in sequence. \n",

    ">Using the Enron data from HW1 and Hadoop MapReduce, write  a mapper/reducer job(s) that\n",
    ">   will both learn  Naive Bayes classifier and classify the Enron email messages using the learnt Naive Bayes classifier. Use all white-space delimitted tokens as independent input variables (assume spaces, fullstops, commas as delimiters). Note: for multinomial Naive Bayes, the Pr(X=“assistance”|Y=SPAM) is calculated as follows:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   the number of times “assistance” occurs in SPAM labeled documents / the number of words in documents labeled SPAM \n",
    ">\n",
    ">   E.g.,   “assistance” occurs 5 times in all of the documents Labeled SPAM, and the length in terms of the number of words in all documents labeled as SPAM (when concatenated) is 1,000. Then Pr(X=“assistance”|Y=SPAM) = 5/1000. Note this is a multinomial estimation of the class conditional for a Naive Bayes Classifier. No smoothing is needed in this HW. Multiplying lots of probabilities, which are between 0 and 1, can result in floating-point underflow. Since log(xy) = log(x) + log(y), it is better to perform all computations by summing logs of probabilities rather than multiplying probabilities. Please pay attention to probabilites that are zero! They will need special attention. Count up how many times you need to process a zero probabilty for each class and report. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">   Report the performance of your learnt classifier in terms of misclassifcation error rate of your multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier. Plot a histogram of the  posterior probabilities (i.e., Pr(Class|Doc)) for each class over the training set. Summarize what you see. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">   Error Rate = misclassification rate with respect to a provided set (say training set in this case). It is more formally defined here:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Let DF represent the evalution set in the following:\n",
    ">Err(Model, DF) = |{(X, c(X)) ∈ DF : c(X) != Model(x)}|   / |DF|\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Where || denotes set cardinality; c(X) denotes the class of the tuple X in DF; and Model(X) denotes the class inferred by the Model “Model”"
