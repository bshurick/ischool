    "bicycle safety in London (taken from an article in ASA's Significance Magazine):  The City of London adopted a measure to improve safety of bicyclists.  Before it was implemented, there were 6e-6 collisions per week per bicyclist, of which 5% were deadly.  After implementation, the fatality of a collision dropped to 3%, but their frequency increased to 9e-6 collisions per week per bicyclist, of which 3% were deadly: riders started to believe in their immortality, because the measure was well advertised, and started doing silly things on the roads.  Did the measure make a difference?"
